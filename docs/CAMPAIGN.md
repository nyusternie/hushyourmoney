<h3>The team at <a href="https://bchplease.org" target="_blank" class="text-primary">Bitcoin Cash Please</a> proudly introduces <span class="text-success">Hush Your Money</span> as the debut campaign for the NEW Causes Cash funding platform.</h3>



<div class="p-3 text-secondary">

<h3>Foreword</h3>



<p>

I've been involved in Bitcoin since late '12 and Bitcoin Cash since the start of '20. As my first "official" contribution to this community, I'm very excited to present a platform that will surely encourage more BUIDLers to test their ideas, knowing they'll have the financial support of the community for those ideas that are deemed to add value to Bitcoin Cash and the greater crypto community at large.

<h3>A case study for Causes Cash</h3>



<p>

As many of you may know, my efforts since the start of 2020 have been to grow BUIDLing for the upcoming bull-run. This project will serve as a case study for the nascent Causes Cash platform on how to go from start-to-finish and beyond with a funding campaign.

</p>



<p>

Regardless of the success of this funding campaign, I certainly plan to complete this work by end-of-year, however, with the support and appreciate of the community, I'd be very happy to move this work to the top of the BCH Please roadmap.

</p>



<p>

In addition, this campaign provides an opportunity to dog-food the new Causes Cash newly developed functions. Ideally, we'll smooth out the rough edges before you hit them.

### Simply the fastest, safest way to shuffle your Bitcoin Cash & SLP tokens



As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) takes over the entire crypto world, Bitcoin Cash is sorely lagging behind in keeping up with the latest/hottest trends.



2nd layer privacy protocols CashShuffle and CashFusion should be the stars of the network, however, they're both being dramatically underutilized today due to the their limited accessibility by way of desktop-based Electron Cash.



With greater access to privacy protocols and expanded use to SLP tokens, we believe we can migrate a portion of the Tether's current Ethereum user-base to Bitcoin Cash.



Now that stablecoins are being added to the SLP protocol, it's time to consider the privacy of your token in addition to your coins.



<span class="text-danger">Shuffle.cash is a <a href="https://gitlab.com/bchplease/shuffle-cash" target="_blank"><strong class="text-danger">100% open-source (MIT licensed)</strong></a> mobile-first decentralized application. You are highly encouraged to use the app by either downloading the package to your local PC or by connecting via your preferred (immutable) IPFS gateway when on mobile.</span>



### Value proposition



1. Incentivizes Tether users from other blockchains _(eg. Ethereum ERC-20)_ to Bitcoin Cash SLP.

2. Server-less communications makes shuffling __UNSTOPPABLE__ _(like BitTorrent)._

3. Largest liquidity pool w/ the combined contribution of __ALL__ node providers.



### Compared to CashFusion



1. Will work in __ANY__ web browser and be supported by __ALL__ mobile devices.

2. Average shuffle completion time of __under 10 seconds__ vs. 5+ minutes on CF.

3. Doesn't require __TOR__ for anonymity protection.



## Primary project goals



<span class="text-danger">In the spirit of <strong>"Making Bitcoin Cash Again"</strong> this project will initially focus on growing the adoption of Bitcoin Cash SLP stablecoins, notably the recently added Tether (USDt), by <strong>introducing an unstoppable (BitTorrent-style) peer-to-peer shuffling protocol.</strong></span>



1. Introduce __[Tether (USDt)](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/9fc89d6b7d5be2eac0b3787c5b8236bca5de641b5bafafc8f450727b63615c11)__ token shuffling

2. Introduce a __server-less communications__ protocol

3. Introduce __dynamic tiers__ for players _(min: 3 / max: 15)_



## Timeline



Our team aims to develop and deploy this platform (as alpha) in 8 weeks.



Start time: __Tuesday, Sept 1st 2020__

Est completion time: __"Shuffle" Saturday, Oct 31st 2020__



## USDt token shuffling



Similar to the current CashShuffle protocol, there will be 8 pools for USDt shufflers to choose from.



| Tier # | Tier Value (in USDt) | Min Shuffle Transaction (in USD) |

| :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------: |

| 1 |  $0.01           | $0.03            |

| 2 |  $0.10           | $0.30            |

| 3 |  $1.00           | $3.00            |

| 4 |  $10.00         | $30.00          |

| 5 |  $100.00       | $300.00        |

| 6 |  $1,000.00    | $3,000.00     |

| 7 | $10,000.00   | $30,000.00   |

| 8 | $100,000.00 | $300,000.00 |



_(transactions based on a minimum of 3 players per tier)_



## Server-less protocol communications



__UNSTOPPABLE.__ That is what CashShuffle will be regarded as once this new server-less network is deployed and adoption begins.



## Dynamic tier players



Currently each pool is restricted to just 5 players, no more, no less. This network would allow for participants to decide the number of "minimum" participants they prefer, allowing for fast shuffle times even during times of lower liquidity.



## Use of funds



In return for community support in the amount of ~$20k (65 BCH), our team will allocate the received funds as follows:



| Description | Amount (in BCH) | Amount (in USD) |

| :------------- | :----------: | :----------: |

| Server-less development | 35 | ~10,500 |

| Front-end development | 10 | ~3,000 |

| Protocol Development | 8 | ~2,400 |

| Documentation & translations | 4 | ~1,200 |

| Bootstrap optimal BCH/SLP liquidity for the first 5 of 8 tiers | 3 | ~900 |

| Media development | 3 | ~900 |

| Misc | 2 | ~600 |

| __Total__ | __65__ | __~19,500__ |

## Stretch goals



<span class="text-danger">In the event that we complete our primary funding goal, our team will immediately seek to secure further funding for our individual stretch goals. <strong>Our end-game for this project will see a "server-less" CashFusion protocol successfully integrated &amp; deployed in at least one major SLP mobile wallet.</strong></span>



| Goal # | Description | Time | Amount<br/>(in BCH) | Amount<br/>(in USD) |

| :-------------: | :---------- | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |

| 1 | Server-less __CashShuffle__ into at least one SLP mobile wallet | 6 weeks | 50 | ~15k |

| 2 | Server-less communications network for __CashFusion__ | 6 weeks | 50 | ~15k |

| 3 | Server-less __CashFusion__ into at least one SLP mobile wallet | 8 weeks | 65 | ~20k |

| 4 | Comprehensive __security audit__ plus optimize pool __liquidity__ | 8 / 12 weeks | 100 / 175 | ~$30k / ~$50k |



<br/>



### GOAL 1: Server-less CashShuffle into at least one SLP mobile wallet



It would be advantageous to have an unstoppable shuffling platform, in the event that any of the current CashShuffle & CashFusion server(s) were ever "forcibly" shut down.



### GOAL 2: Server-less communications network for CashFusion



### GOAL 3: Server-less CashFusion into at least one SLP mobile wallet



The goal here is to integrate the CashShuffle protocol into at least one leading mobile wallet (ie. Bitcoin.com, Crescent, Badger, etc)



### GOAL 4a: Comprehensive security audit



For your safety, we would like to conduct a full security audit of our code and procedures to minimize the risk of loss of funds.



1. Adequate data storage & backup

2. Intrusion detection



### GOAL 4b: Optimization of pool liquidity



Many would argue that the #1 benefit of the CashShuffle protocol is the __SPEED__ at which it completes its process from start to finish. Most of our liquidity tests saw speeds averaging under 10 seconds per shuffle.



Any remaining funds will be applied towards managing the shuffle liquidity pool for the supported SLP tokens.



Note that due to the risk of running a hot wallet, only the first 6 tiers are supported by supported by our liquidity provider.



| Tier Value (in BCH) | Liquidity Value (in BCH) | Liquidity Value (in USD) |

| :-------------: | :----------: | :----------: |

|  0.0001     | 0.0002   | ~$0.06        |

|  0.001       | 0.002     | ~$0.60        |

|  0.01         | 0.02       | ~$6.00        |

|  0.1           | 0.2         | ~$60.00      |

|  1.0           | 2.0         | ~$600.00    |

|  10.0         | 20.0       | ~$6,000.00 |

|  __Total__ | __22.2222__ | __~6,700.00__ |



_(based on a maximum of 2 liquidity providers per tier)_
