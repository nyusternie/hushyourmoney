<strong class="text-danger">Hush Your Money introduces SLP/token anonymity to Bitcoin Cash</strong>

Our team is seeking an initial __75 BCH (~$20k)__ to develop the (front & back-end) infrastructure plus p2p protocols for a __serverless, trustless__ shuffling network with native support for the __Uncensorable Tether (USDt) SLP__ tokens.

<h3>Foreword</h3>

Greetings my fellow Bitcoiners! I've enjoyed each and every opportunity I've had to meet and come to better know so many of you in this budding community. I most appreciate the mutual desire we all share of __Making Bitcoin Cash Again;__ and so I offer Causes Cash for the exclusive purpose of supporting the financial needs of the many __BUIDLers__ (coders, designers, translators and more) it'll take to make that happen.

I started developing on Bitcoin Legacy (BTC) back in 2012, but only discovered Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at the start of 2020. As my first "official" contribution to this amazing community, I'm very excited to present a platform that I'm sure will __encourage more BUIDLers to create, test and deploy their innovative ideas__ with greater confidence in receiving the financial support that up until now was reserved for blockchains with pre-mined token sales.

Launching a new platform sometimes comes with one or more false starts. After a failed attempt to __["Save Tobias"](https://read.cash/@nyusternie/flipstarter-for-mobile-web-has-arrived-no-plugins-required-93fb1996#case-study-1-save-tobias)__ from the allure of an __8% Coinbase Tax,__ I've decided to try again with a campaign of my own. I can only hope that you find it to be of great value to our already rich community.

### CASE STUDY #2: Hush Your Money

This is __NOT__ just another Flipstarter. It's the inaugural campaign of a __Volunteer Funding Platform__ for fund raising and accountability of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Causes Cash is where __Patreon__ meets __Open Collective,__ wrapped in the trustless assurance of Flipstarter.

For better or worse, __$6,001,007.56 Tether (USDt)__ have been recently added as SLP tokens. Most notably, these Tether SLP tokens __CANNOT__ be censored (with address blocking) like their Ethereum counterparts. This alone presents an exciting opportunity for migrating Ethereum's current __$8,617,328,861.70__ (or 64% of ALL Tether tokens) over to Bitcoin Cash; and with it the migration of its users. (source: https://wallet.tether.to/transparency)

Unfortunately, __blockchain analysis may still result in censorship,__ especially when dealing with centralized and/or custodial service providers (eg. exchanges). All Tether tokens in circulation today suffer from a __lack of fungibility;__ fortunately this is a problem that __ONLY__ Bitcoin Cash is ready to solve.

__Now is the perfect time to introduce CashShuffle & CashFusion for SLP tokens.__

<!-- Project Goals -->
<!-- ######################################## -->

<br />![Project Goals](https://i.imgur.com/eGbmTF6.png)

This project was chosen specifically because our team believes it offers the greatest potential for __driving the most adoption__ during this latest bull run cycle. __Our long-term goal is to make SLP the default protocol for ALL stablecoin money transfers.__ Ambitious from the start, this project has __3 main goals__ along with 4 stretch goals:

1. Introduce __[Tether (USDt)](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/9fc89d6b7d5be2eac0b3787c5b8236bca5de641b5bafafc8f450727b63615c11)__ token shuffling

2. Introduce a __serverless communications__ protocols for CashShuffle & CashFusion

3. Introduce __instant shuffling__ using anonymous liquidity pools

### Value proposition

1. Incentivizes Tether users from other blockchains (eg. Ethereum ERC-20) to Bitcoin Cash SLP.
2. Serverless communications makes shuffling __UNSTOPPABLE__ (like BitTorrent).
3. Largest liquidity pool w/ the combined contribution of __ALL__ node providers.

### Comparison to CashFusion

1. Will work in __ANY__ web browser and be supported by __ALL__ mobile devices.
2. Average shuffle completion time of __under 10 seconds__ vs. 5+ minutes on CF.
3. Doesn't require __TOR__ for anonymity protection.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has taken off and with it the majority of the money and talent.

As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) takes over the entire crypto world, Bitcoin Cash is sorely lagging behind in keeping up with the latest/hottest trends.

2nd layer privacy protocols CashShuffle and CashFusion should be the stars of the network, however, they're both being dramatically underutilized today due to the their limited accessibility by way of desktop-based Electron Cash.

With greater access to privacy protocols and expanded use to SLP tokens, we believe we can migrate a portion of the Tether's current Ethereum user-base to Bitcoin Cash.

Now that stablecoins are being added to the SLP protocol, it's time to consider the privacy of your token in addition to your coins.


<!-- ######################################## -->
<!-- Timeline -->
<!-- ######################################## -->

<br />![Timeline](https://i.imgur.com/OR6NTaV.png)

Our team aims to develop and deploy this platform (as alpha) in 8 weeks.

Start time: __Tuesday, Sept 15th 2020__

Est completion time: __"Shuffle" Saturday, Oct 31st 2020__


<!-- ######################################## -->
<!-- Tether (USDt) -->
<!-- ######################################## -->

<br />![Tether (USDt)](https://i.imgur.com/oijwlUS.png)

Similar to the current CashShuffle protocol, there will be 8 pools for USDt shufflers to choose from.

| Tier # | Tier Value (in USDt) | Min Shuffle Transaction (in USD) |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------: |
| 1 |  $0.01           | $0.03            |
| 2 |  $0.10           | $0.30            |
| 3 |  $1.00           | $3.00            |
| 4 |  $10.00         | $30.00          |
| 5 |  $100.00       | $300.00        |
| 6 |  $1,000.00    | $3,000.00     |
| 7 | $10,000.00   | $30,000.00   |
| 8 | $100,000.00 | $300,000.00 |

(transactions based on a minimum of 3 players per tier)


<!-- ######################################## -->
<!-- Serverless -->
<!-- ######################################## -->

<br />![Serverless](https://i.imgur.com/VZhZ3xV.png)

__UNSTOPPABLE.__ That is what CashShuffle will be regarded as once this new serverless network is deployed and adoption begins.


<!-- ######################################## -->
<!-- Dynamic Tiers -->
<!-- ######################################## -->

<br />![Dynamic Tiers](https://i.imgur.com/oPFKxSI.png)

Currently each pool is restricted to just 5 players, no more, no less. This network would allow for participants to decide the number of "minimum" participants they prefer, allowing for fast shuffle times even during times of lower liquidity.


<!-- ######################################## -->
<!-- Use of funds -->
<!-- ######################################## -->

<br />![Use of funds](https://i.imgur.com/zlFdWPv.png)

1. All funds received will be split 50/50 into 2 treasuries of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and various stable coins.
2. BCH-friendly providers will be prioritized for ALL 3rd-party services required.
3. ONLY BCH-friendly contractors will be used during development.

Schedule:

Based on the success of our Stretch Goals, there may be adjustments made to the development schedule.

While we can’t predict exactly when work will begin and end for each of this campaign’s “deliverables” (tasks that have a concrete, measurable point of completion), we can at least roughly predict how many man-hours they will require to complete, which allows us to predict their costs.

Accountability:

Funds will be stored in a publicly auditable wallet. We publish a monthly report covering that month’s progress, issues, spending.

In return for community support in the amount of ~$20k (65 BCH), our team will allocate the received funds as follows:

| Description | Amount (in BCH) | Amount (in USD) |
| :------------- | :----------: | :----------: |
| Serverless development | 35 | ~10,500 |
| Front-end development | 10 | ~3,000 |
| Protocol Development | 8 | ~2,400 |
| Documentation & translations | 4 | ~1,200 |
| Bootstrap optimal BCH/SLP liquidity for the first 5 of 8 tiers | 3 | ~900 |
| Media development | 3 | ~900 |
| Misc | 2 | ~600 |
| __Total__ | __65__ | __~19,500__ |


<!-- ######################################## -->
<!-- Stretch Goals -->
<!-- ######################################## -->

<br />![Stretch Goals](https://i.imgur.com/GbDmvAn.png)

<span class="text-danger">In the event that we complete our primary funding goal, our team will immediately seek to secure further funding for our individual stretch goals. <strong>Our end-game for this project will see a "serverless" CashFusion protocol successfully integrated &amp; deployed in at least one major SLP mobile wallet.</strong></span>

| Goal # | Description | Duration | Amount<br/>(in BCH) | Amount<br/>(in USD) |
| :-------------: | :---------- | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| 1 | Serverless __CashShuffle__ into at least one SLP mobile wallet | 6 weeks | 50 | ~15k |
| 2 | Serverless communications network for __CashFusion__ | 6 weeks | 50 | ~15k |
| 3 | Serverless __CashFusion__ into at least one SLP mobile wallet | 8 weeks | 65 | ~20k |
| 4 | Comprehensive __security audit__ plus optimize pool __liquidity__ | 8 / 12 weeks | 100 / 175 | ~$30k / ~$50k |

<br/>

### GOAL 1: Serverless CashShuffle into at least one SLP mobile wallet

It would be advantageous to have an unstoppable shuffling platform, in the event that any of the current CashShuffle & CashFusion server(s) were ever "forcibly" shut down.

### GOAL 2: Serverless communications network for CashFusion

...

### GOAL 3: Serverless CashFusion into at least one SLP mobile wallet

The goal here is to integrate the CashShuffle protocol into at least one leading mobile wallet (ie. Bitcoin.com, Crescent, Badger, etc)

### GOAL 4a: Comprehensive security audit

For your safety, we would like to conduct a full security audit of our code and procedures to minimize the risk of loss of funds.

1. Adequate data storage & backup

2. Intrusion detection

### GOAL 4b: Optimization of pool liquidity

Many would argue that the #1 benefit of the CashShuffle protocol is the __SPEED__ at which it completes its process from start to finish. Most of our liquidity tests saw speeds averaging under 10 seconds per shuffle.

Any remaining funds will be applied towards managing the shuffle liquidity pool for the supported SLP tokens.

Note that due to the risk of running a hot wallet, only the first 6 tiers are supported by supported by our liquidity provider.

| Tier # | Tier Value (in BCH) | Liquidity Value (in BCH) | Liquidity Value (in USD) |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| 1 |  0.0001     | 0.0002   | ~$0.06        |
| 2 |  0.001       | 0.002     | ~$0.60        |
| 3 |  0.01         | 0.02       | ~$6.00        |
| 4 |  0.1           | 0.2         | ~$60.00      |
| 5 |  1.0           | 2.0         | ~$600.00    |
| 6 |  10.0         | 20.0       | ~$6,000.00 |
| | __Total__ | __22.2222__ | __~6,700.00__ |

(based on a maximum of 2 liquidity providers per tier)

# How to keep your coins private

> Be aware that Bitcoin privacy is NOT built-in to the protocol. This is why it is important to understand the best practices to maintaining your on-chain privacy.

## Introduction to UTXO 101

Your coins are spent as entries in the blockchain. It is NOT possible to spend a partial entry, so any remaining value is added to a NEW blockchain entry.

1. begin
2. continue
3. complete

### Q: Why serverless communications?

__A:__ It would be advantageous to have an unstoppable shuffling platform, in the event that any of the current CashShuffle & CashFusion server(s) were ever "forcibly" shut down.
