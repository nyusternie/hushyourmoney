            While Bitcoin is considered to be a privacy-oriented system, the blockchain is open to analyze by anyone, and there are numerous transaction tracing tools like Chainalysis, Coinfirm, Elliptic, CipherTrace, and Crystal.
            They're all not free, and Bitcoin users rarely have a chance to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
            <strong>We start with a simple transaction scoring tool, and will soon expand this even further.</strong>
            We'll provide this service for free as we hope it'd help Bitcoin users to take some of their privacy back.

            Cypherpunks' dream of free and independent payment methods seems be a notion from light years ago.
            Here and now have to deal with the harsh reality.
            <strong>The regulation of cryptocurrencies is following suit of how the bank industry is being controlled.</strong>
